# File catalog project

## Problem statement:

We have a lot of files (images, music, movies, documents, etc) storing in hard disk under separate folders. How should we organise these content?

The concept of organisation is different from storage. Storage describes how you handle the files, i.e, folder hierarchy, folder names. While organisation means how the files are grouped according to content, usage or value, aka metadata.

There are 2 main challenges with using folders for organisation:
  - The limitation of folder hierarchy & group filter (date, size)
  - If you remove a image from a folder designating what that image is, that content information can be lost.

This application aims to provide a solution for organizing file using metadata.
