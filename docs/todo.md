# TODO

1. onItemClick is firing on all panel components. Limit it to parent component only.

- Done: using PureComponent

2. SearchBox to fetch data from db instead of filter current pagination

- Need to validate and escape form input


3. Keyboard event that load/click next page: implement pagination on first and last item reach.

- Done
